Purpose:		Demonstration of dead key hotstrings used to enter diacritic characters (actually Polish diacritics).

Notes:		Actually key used to enter diacritics is not dead as it is displayed on the screen, but concept is similar: two keys have to be entered to get one diacritic key. As "dead key" the slash "/" is applied.

Example:		/a → ą
