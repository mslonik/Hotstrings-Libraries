Purpose: Polish diacritics (accented letters) produced without pressing of RightAlt key (AltGr) by a thumb. Instead the "/" is used as trigger.

Notes: Output Function column in this library must be always S2. This is the only function which is allowed for the library, which name starts from "S2". What is special about "S2" is that "hotstring" is returned to triggerstring recognizer buffer and as a consequence can be recognized again.

Example:

*?‖numlock/‖S2‖En‖{NumLock}‖
*?‖scrolllock/‖S2‖En‖{ScrollLock}‖
