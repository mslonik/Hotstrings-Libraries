Purpose:		Definitions which can be used to run specific hotkeys for Hotstring application.

Notes:		For example Hotstrings application is configured by user to switch triggerstring tips when ScrollLock is pressed, even if ScrollLock is not available
               on specific keyboard, this hotstring still can be run and it will activate Hotstrings application.
               This is "S2" (special function category 2). It means that the whole hotstring will be feedback (fed in) to Hotstrings application.

Examples:	     numlock/ -> NumLock will be pressed even if it is not physically available on particular keyboard and such hotstring will be sent to Hotstrins application.
