*Z‖agilemanifesto‖SI‖En‖The Manifesto for Agile Software Development is based on twelve principles:`n`n1. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.`n2. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.`n3. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months).`n4. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers.`n5. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted.`n6. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location).`n7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.`n8. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace.`n9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design.`n10. Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.`n11. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.`n12. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly.‖

*Z‖bloomstaxonomy/‖SI‖En‖Bloom's Taxonomy is a set of three hierarchical models used for classification of educational learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity. The three lists cover the learning objectives in cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains. The cognitive domain list has been the primary focus of most traditional education and is frequently used to structure curriculum learning objectives, assessments and activities.`n`nremember: recall facts and basic concepts (define, duplicate, list, memorize, repeat, state)`nunderstand: explain ideas or concepts (classify, describe, discuss, explain, identify, locate, recognize, report, select, translate)`napply: use information in new situations (execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate, interpret, operate, schedule, sketch)`nanalyze: draw connections among ideas (differentiate, organize, relate, compare, contrast, distinguish, examine, experiment, question, test)`nevaluate: justify a stand or decision (appraise, argue, defend, judge, select, support, value, critique, weigh)`ncreate: produce new or original work (design, assemble, construct, conjecture, develop, formulate, author, investigate)‖

*Z‖dorametrics/‖SI‖En‖Deployment Frequency — How often an organization successfully releases to production.`n`nLead Time for Changes — The amount of time it takes a commit to get into production.`n`nChange Failure Rate — The percentage of deployments causing a failure in production.`n`nTime to Restore Service — How long it takes an organization to recover from a failure in production.‖

*Z‖selfdiscrepancyhiggings‖SI‖En‖The theory postulates three basic domains of the self:`n`nActual self is one's representation of the attributes that one believes one actually possesses, or that one believes others believe one possesses. The "actual self" is a person's basic self-concept. It is one's perception of their own attributes (intelligence, athleticism, attractiveness, etc.).`n`nIdeal self is one's representation of the attributes that someone (oneself or another) would like one, ideally, to possess (i.e., a representation of someone's hopes, aspirations, or wishes for one).[4] The "ideal-self" is what usually motivates individuals to change, improve and achieve.`n`nThe ideal self-regulatory system focuses on the presence or absence of positive outcomes (e.g., love provided or withdrawn).`n`nOught is one's representation of the attributes that someone (oneself or another) believes one should or ought to possess (i.e., a representation of someone's sense of one's duty, obligations, or responsibilities). The ought self-regulatory system focuses on the presence or absence of negative outcomes (e.g., criticism administered or suspended).‖
