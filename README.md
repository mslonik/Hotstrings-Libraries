### **AbbreviationsEnglish.csv** <a name="abbreviations-english"></a>

**License**:		CC BY-SA Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike

**Author**:		Maciej S≈Çojewski (üêò)

**Purpose**: Acronyms (fitting into cathegory of abbreviations) can be used in up to 3x forms:
- short version, e.g. **ADC**,
- expanded version, e.g. **Analog to Digital Converter**,
- full version, explaining definition of acronym: 

Thanks to **Hotstrings** application all three forms can be easily applied.

**Example**:

| triggerstring + trigger | ‚Üí | (triggerstring) options | ‚Üí |                                                                                                hotstring                                                                                                | output function |
|:-----------------------:|:-:|:-----------------------:|:-:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------:|
|           adc           | ‚Üí |            C            | ‚Üí |                                                                                                   ADC                                                                                                   |       SI        |
|          adc/           | ‚Üí |            *            | ‚Üí | Analog to Digital Converter¬¶analog-to-digital converter is a system that converts an analog signal, such as a sound picked up by a microphone or light entering a digital camera, into a digital signal |       MSI       |

**Remarks:** 

1. Convention. For any of my *Abbreviation** libraries I use the following convention: 
   - If I want to immediately trigger a triggerstring, I use one of the characters freely available keys of keyboard, but seldomly used for other purposes. There are coupe of candidates: "~", "/", "\". I decided to use "/" as it is relatively easy reachable.
   - According to my style of writing, a short version of acronym is usually present at the end of a sentence. To trigger automatic text replacement it is enough to press one of usual triggers just after short version (e.g. adc and space, dot (.), colon (,) etc.). This way I don't have to enter any of acronym letters as capitals - they are converted to capitals by AutoHotkey automatically. It speeds up writing enormously on longer run. Additionally I use option "C": in case I'd enter abbreviation in capital letters (following above example: ADC), then AutoHotkey is not used to convert it between small letters and capital letters, what spares some time of microprocessor üòâ.
   - Additionally for reference purposes for some definitions I use comment field (part of hotstring definition) for storage of link to definition (e.g. from Wikipedia).

1. Unification of language / culture.
   - If many people use the same set of abbreviations and definitions in written form, it builds at customers confidence and understanding. The same terms, the same definitions brings together and reduces area for misunderstanding. You can use **Hotstrings** aplication as basic aid for understanding.
   - You can use the same principle for definitions and names of your products in your company. For example all people in e-mail correspondence will use the same, unified definitions, no matter if it is technical documentation, datasheet or just a marketing leaflet.

1. Sometimes acronym names are the same as entire word. Good example in English is word "can". There is also acronym "CAN" which can stand for "Controller Area Network". It can be sometimes confusing when it is triggered automatically in unwanted situation. The fallback scenario is to undo last hotstring by pressing shortcut key combination dedicated to Hotstring application and that purpose (by default Win + Z). But if it is still unconvenient, you can define another triggerstring. For this particular acronym I use can\<Tab>, what is denoted as "can\`t", where "\`t" stands for \<Tab> or tabulator key.

### **AutocompleteBrackets.csv** <a name="autocomplete-brackets"></a>

**License**:		CC BY-SA Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike

**Author**:		Maciej S≈Çojewski (üêò)

**Purpose**: Usually brackets come in pairs, e.g. after the opening ordinary bracket "(" comes the closing one ")". Definitions within this library automatically add closing bracket and also shifts cursor position in between pair of brackets in order to enable typing.

**Example**:

| triggerstring + trigger | ‚Üí | (triggerstring) options | ‚Üí |   hotstring   | output function |
|:-----------------------:|:-:|:-----------------------:|:-:|:-------------:|:---------------:|
|           (            | ‚Üí |           *B0           | ‚Üí | ){left} |       SI       |

Meaning of options:
- "*" the trigger is a part of triggerstring (trigger = "(").
- B0 the triggerstring will be not erased (Backspaced).

Meaning of hotstring:
- {left} stands for special keyboard key: left cursor "‚Üê".

**Remarks**:
1. The hotstrings are so common and handy that keys used for closing brackets can be reserved for other purposes, e.g. can be used as triggers.

### DiacriticsDeadkey_Polish.csv <a name="diacritics-deadkey-polish"></a>
**License**:		CC BY-SA Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike

**Author**:		   Maciej S≈Çojewski (üêò)

**Purpose**:      Demonstration of dead key hotstrings used to enter diacritic characters (actually Polish diacritics). Actually key used to enter diacritics is not dead as it is displayed on the screen, but concept is similar: two keys have to be entered to get one diacritic key. As "dead key" the slash "/" is applied.

**Example**:

| triggerstring + trigger | ‚Üí | (triggerstring) options | ‚Üí |   hotstring   | output function |
|:-----------------------:|:-:|:-----------------------:|:-:|:-------------:|:---------------:|
|           /a            | ‚Üí |           *C?           | ‚Üí | ƒÖ |       SI       |

### **DiacriticsHotstrings.csv** <a name="diacritics-hotstrings"></a>

**License**:		CC BY-SA Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike

**Author**:		Maciej S≈Çojewski (üêò)

**Purpose**:   [Accents or Diacritics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic) is a glyph added to a letter. Sometimes it is useful to enter one accented character without a need to temporarily switch keyboard layout or code page. For example correct spelling of French originated term "a la" is "√† la" with accented "√†".

**Example**:

| triggerstring + trigger | ‚Üí | (triggerstring) options | ‚Üí |   hotstring   | output function |
|:-----------------------:|:-:|:-----------------------:|:-:|:-------------:|:---------------:|
|           a^            | ‚Üí |           C*?           | ‚Üí | √•¬¶√§¬¶√¢¬¶√†¬¶√°¬¶ƒÖ¬¶ƒÅ |       MSI       |

Meaning of options:
- "?" whenever before triggerstring any alphanumeric is detected, the hotstring is triggered. This definition can be called even from within any word.

### **BuildingBlocks.csv** <a name="building-blocks"></a>

**Concept**: Building blocks from Microsoft Word template file (.dotm or .dotx) must belong to "autotext" category. After entering "autotext" dedicated to specific building block F3 key has to be pressed. Next building block is inserted into document content. The definitions belonging to this library make sense only when: 1. Microsoft Word is open. 2. Active Microsoft Word document has attached specific template file.

**Example**:
| triggerstring + trigger | ‚Üí | (triggerstring) options | ‚Üí |   hotstring   | output function |
|:-----------------------:|:-:|:-----------------------:|:-:|:-------------:|:---------------:|
|           @copyrights            | ‚Üí |           *           | ‚Üí |  Copyrights{F3} |       SI       |

```
Company specific copyright note.
```

Comment:
- special character "F3" is called by entering in between curved brackets "{F3}"
