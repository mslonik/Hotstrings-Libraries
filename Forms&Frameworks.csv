The three lists cover the learning objectives in cognitive, affective and psychomotor domains. The cognitive domain list has been the primary focus of most traditional education and is frequently used to structure curriculum learning objectives, assessments and activities.`n`nremember: recall facts and basic concepts (define, duplicate, list, memorize, repeat, state)`nunderstand: explain ideas or concepts (classify, describe, discuss, explain, identify, locate, recognize, report, select, translate)`napply: use information in new situations (execute, implement, solve, use, demonstrate, interpret, operate, schedule, sketch)`nanalyze: draw connections among ideas (differentiate, organize, relate, compare, contrast, distinguish, examine, experiment, question, test)`nevaluate: justify a stand or decision (appraise, argue, defend, judge, select, support, value, critique, weigh)`ncreate: produce new or original work (design, assemble, construct, conjecture, develop, formulate, author, investigate)‖

*Z‖selfdiscrepancyhiggings‖SI‖En‖The theory postulates three basic domains of the self:`n`nActual self is one's representation of the attributes that one believes one actually possesses, or that one believes others believe one possesses. The "actual self" is a person's basic self-concept. It is one's perception of their own attributes (intelligence, athleticism, attractiveness, etc.).`n`nIdeal self is one's representation of the attributes that someone (oneself or another) would like one, ideally, to possess (i.e., a representation of someone's hopes, aspirations, or wishes for one).[4] The "ideal-self" is what usually motivates individuals to change, improve and achieve.`n`nThe ideal self-regulatory system focuses on the presence or absence of positive outcomes (e.g., love provided or withdrawn).`n`nOught is one's representation of the attributes that someone (oneself or another) believes one should or ought to possess (i.e., a representation of someone's sense of one's duty, obligations, or responsibilities). The ought self-regulatory system focuses on the presence or absence of negative outcomes (e.g., criticism administered or suspended).‖
